### Utilities Created

- `utils/calculators.ts` — Pure TypeScript: `calculateEMI`, `calculateEligibility`, `formatINR`, `formatINRLabel`

### Configuration

- `config.json` — Centralized company info, WhatsApp URL, SEO metadata, version
- `scripts/start.sh` — Dev/prod server launcher
- `scripts/stop.sh` — Port 3000 process killer

### Design Decisions

- **Color palette:** Deep Blue (#0f2d5a) + Green (#16a34a) — finance + trust
- **WhatsApp-first:** Every section has at least one WhatsApp CTA
- **No backend:** 100% frontend static site — deployable on Vercel/Netlify
- **Calculator formulas:** Shown in click-triggered tooltips (not modals) for clean UX
- **Form-to-WhatsApp:** Contact form pre-fills WhatsApp message, no server needed
- **Mobile-first:** Navbar collapses, cards stack, stats grid 2-col on mobile
- **Floating WA button:** Appears after 200px scroll on mobile; always visible on desktop
- **Video placeholder:** Clean placeholder until actual video content is provided

### SEO

- Full Open Graph tags
- Twitter card meta
- Robots crawl enabled
- Author metadata from config
- Descriptive page title and meta description

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-14

### Netlify Deployment Support

- Changed port from 3000 → 5001
- Added `output: "export"` to `next.config.ts` — enables static HTML/CSS/JS build in `/out`
- Added `trailingSlash: true` for Netlify clean URL compatibility
- Created `netlify.toml` — build command, publish dir (`out`), Node version, SPA redirect rule
- Static export verified: `npm run build` generates `/out/index.html` successfully

*Future changes should be documented here with version, date, and description.*
